SmartContractManager -> The address were we deploy is know after contract's deployment
SmartContractManager -> Manage claims in checkpoint TODO - FUTURE WORK
Peer -> Send a message create after creating a block, IDEA NOT CHANGING PROTOCOL, 		everybody creates its own in memory storage chain, ONLY LEADER IS
	CONTACTED IN CHECKPOINT BY THE TRUSTED PEER
Peer -> Trustiness of news in queue, MAYBE EQUAL TO THE ONE THAT MATCHES ? 
	TODO FUTURE WORK
Peer -> LONG CAHIN in lucky case, for now skipped, checked only ACK and DUPLICATE

Other parameters to Tune in PEER:
Timer for creating block
Number of rows per block
Timer for Byzantine mismatch

Other parameters to Tune in TRUSTED PEER:
Read from queue and 1L in checkpoint (now 80-20 %)

Parameters to tune:
Consensus 5w quorum : MAYBE BASED ON VOTER AND TIME
Queue struct for high and low trustiness (ex. 60 % and 20 %)
Threshold of number of documents to be analyzed in algorithm
